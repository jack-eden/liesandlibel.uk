<p>Hi, my name is Jack Eden and I'm a table-top RPG nerd.</p> 

<p>I started this blog to hold my entries for the <a href="https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23">Dungeon23</a> daily Ritual. I didn't have to make a personal website from scratch in order to take part in Dungeon23 but I'm hoping that it will be a driver project for more writing in 2023 that I can record here.</p> 

<p>Currently, you can't find me anywhere else but you can email me at jack@liesandlibel.uk if you like (unless you're trying to serve me a legal notice of some kind, in which case please post to: "Correspondence Team, DVLA, Swansea, SA6 7JL, United Kingdom").</p>

<p>This site is built with Jekyll, Github, and Netlify. The font is Overpass and Overpass Mono.</p>
