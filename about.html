<p>Hi, I'm Jack Eden and I'm a tabletop RPG nerd.</p> 

<p>I started this blog to hold my entries for the <a href="https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23">Dungeon23</a> daily Ritual. I didn't have to make a personal website from scratch in order to take part in Dungeon23 but I'm hoping that it will be a driver project for more writing in 2023 that I can record here.</p> 

<p>Currently, you can't find me anywhere else but you can email me at jack@liesandlibel.uk if you like.</p>

<p>This site is built with Jekyll, Github, and Netlify. The font is Overpass and Overpass Mono.</p>
